# Two-dimensional (2D) flow past airfoils

These benchmark cases employ a RANS modeling framework and serve as validation and verification of the 1-eq Gamma Transition Model.
They include the following airfoils and flow parameters:

- NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=4M, Tu=0.15%
- TU Delft DU00-W-212 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=3M, Tu=0.0864%

Read the NLF(1)-0416 case first, then the DU00-W-212 case.
A paper containing detailed validation is currently under review.
