# NREL 5MW Rotor in Atmospheric Boundary Layer With OpenFAST/BeamDyn Fluid Structure Interaction
This benchmark contains a geometry and boundary-layer resolved model of the NREL 5MW reference turbine [1] in a developed near-neutral convective atmospheric boundary layer with a mean hub-height streamwise velocity of 11.4m/s.

- Hub-height: 90m
- Blade Radius: 63m
- Rated Power: 5 MW
- Type: Upwind 3 Blade

<i>Note on run-time: Current results are for 125s simulation time, but by the time of bechmark release, a minimum of 360s will be posted.</i>

## Freestream Conditions
A near-neutral convective boundary layer precursor was run to feed the domain for this case. Full details are posted here: [Convective ABL for NREL5MW](../../../amr-wind/atmospheric_boundary_layer/convective_abl_nrel5mw/README.md)

10 minute flow statistics:
- Hub-height streamwise velocity: 11.63 m/s
- Hub-height flow direction: ~240.0 degrees

Off-body (AMR-Wind) mesh was generated using the built-in capability of AMR-Wind. Off-body mesh information is summarized below 
- Mesh topology: Cartesian with AMR
- Domain in x= 0 to 5000m, y=0m to 5000m, z=0m to 1000m
- Initial grid size: 10m
- Finest cell size: 0.625m with 4 AMR levels
- Cell count: 162,136,064
