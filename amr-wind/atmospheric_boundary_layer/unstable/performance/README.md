This input file was used to run the unstable ABL case that will appear in the AMR-Wind paper. To demostrate that this case runs with the latest release of AMR-Wind, a 100 timestep run was perfomed using 20 nodes on kestrel. The relevant output from this run is:

```
Time spent in InitData():    7.874299979
Time spent in Evolve():      390.3647882
```

leading to an average wall-clock time per time step of 3.9s.
