# AMR-Wind benchmarks
These cases serve as benchmarks for AMR-Wind alone. Currently, the foremost AMR-Wind benchmark cases are simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer, with three stability states included. These are cases featured by the AMR-Wind methods paper. From the same paper, we also include the verification and validation cases. The demonstration case from the paper is hosted elsewhere, at https://github.com/marchdf/wind-farm-demonstration. Among the atmospheric boundary layer benchmarks, there is a fourth case, which is slightly convective, and this case serves as a precursor for turbine simulations in the repository. This includes the actuator line benchmark case, which is in development.
